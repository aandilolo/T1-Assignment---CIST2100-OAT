Task 2: We are focused on customers who need protection online and don't necessarily know the ends and outs of security. So demographically we don't have an age limit per say but it is required that they are able to support themselves and or have a home or bussiness for us to protect.
Task 3: These online sales will be available not only through an app but via our websit as well which provides all the packages as mentioned above. The website will include things to navigate through like a help center, our product information, etc.
Task 5: The surveillance system we offer will hopefully be widespread and available to many through different sources via an app for convinience, a website for those who only have a computer, and also through our offices which provide real time services for phone users only
